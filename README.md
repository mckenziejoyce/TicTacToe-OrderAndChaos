# Assignment 1: Tic Tac Toe
In this assignment I designed and implemented an Object Oriented Tic Tac Toe Game. This game is made for two users to play tic tac toe on a shared terminal. Player X starts the first game and if the players decide to play multiple games each user switches off starting. The players take turns by entering the number corresponding to their desired move. This number must be between 1-9 and the program will not let you continue until you enter a valid input, then the updated board is displayed. The game runs until either a win or stalemate occurs at which point a message will display and the users will have the option to continue playing and start a new game or to quit by typing y/Y or n/N respectively. If the users decide to quit the game summary of total wins and losses for each user will be displayed and the program will terminate.

## Instructions for Running the Program
1. Open terminal
2. `cd` into the directory with ticTacToe.java
3. `javac ticTacToe.java` to compile the program
4. `java ticTacToe` to run the program
